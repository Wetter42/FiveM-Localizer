Sick of landing the VFR?  
Well this is the mod for you! introducing, the simple, yet effective fivem localizer - a mod that allows you to align with the runway from a distance and hold centerline traffic patterns! 

Installation is simple - Drop the folder on your server's resources directory;  

Add a line in your resources.cfg or server.cfg to start or ensure the CaSe SeNsItIvE name of the folder you just dropped; 

for me, that looks like this (without the quotes):
"ensure localizer"

For you it may look like this;
"start localizer"

Once it's been enabled on your server, simply type:
/lizer (airport code) runway number
You can enable as many as you want at once.  

You can toggle it on and off by running the same command twice;

And of course, if you enabled them all, the killswitch command of "/lizer off" can be toggled. 

Enjoy and I'll see you in the skies!
